            <h2>Everything Bagel Seared Tuna Bowl</h2>
            
            <p>
                This everything bagel seared tuna bowl answers the craving for a nice sushi bowl. 
                A quick-seared tuna, coated in everything but the bagel seasoning, 
                is served with a delicious sauce, cooked rice, chopped cucumber, and fresh avocado slices

            <h2>Whole Lemon Blender Cake</h2>
            <p>
                Made from an easy blender batter, this citrus cake comes together in no time and turns out fluffy, tender, and full of fresh flavor. 
                "The glaze adds just the right amount of sweetness to balance the tartness of the lemon,"
                said recipe tester Amanda Holstein. "A really simple way to make a cake!"

            <h2>Teriyaki Salmon Bowl</h2>
            <p>
                For this teriyaki salmon bowl, salmon is baked for 15 minutes with a 4-ingredient homemade teriyaki sauce using soy sauce, 
                brown sugar, garlic, and ginger, then served in a bowl with rice, red cabbage, carrots, and radishes.

            <h2>Sauteed Red cabbage</h2>
            <p>
                This sauteed red cabbage, prepared with vinegar and mustard, 
                is easy to throw together and pairs nicely with grilled meat or smoked sausage. 
                I also like to put it on top of hot dogs like you would sauerkraut. 
                This is pretty tart so you'll want to double the sugar if you like things on the sweeter side.

            <h2>Cafe de Olla</h2>
            <p>
                Cafe de olla is the way coffee is made in Mexico. It translates into “pot of coffee.”
                It's sweetened with piloncillo, which is similar to dark brown sugar and found in Hispanic markets, 
                and spiced with a cinnamon stick to warm you up.

            <h2>Spicy Mango Margarita</h2>
            <p>This spicy mango margarita is a vibrant cocktail that blends sweet mango nectar with a kick of crushed jalapeño - 
                the perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy. Feel free to add extra jalapeno if you're craving more heat.

            <h2>Frozen Smooth Smoothie</h2>
            <p>
                This frozen fruit smoothie is fast, simple, nutritious, and tasty with extra protein from the Greek yogurt.
                 It's a great on-the-go breakfast or afternoon snack. I always include a banana, but choose your favorite frozen fruits such as strawberries, 
                cherries, pineapple, raspberries, and blueberries.

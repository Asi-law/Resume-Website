        <h2>Daffodil Cake</h2>
        <img src="./images/Desert/dafodils.webp" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 eggs whites</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>6 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon orange extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wash the tube pan in hot soapy water to ensure it is totally grease-free.
        </p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            In a large dry glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and salt, and continue to whip. When the whites can form soft peaks, gradually sprinkle in 1 cup sugar, while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            In a separate bowl, beat egg yolks with 1/4 cup sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Blend in 3/4 cup cake flour and orange extract. Fold half of the whipped egg whites into the yolk mixture.
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Fold the remaining 1/2 cup of cake flour into the egg whites, along with the vanilla. Spoon about 1 cup of batter at a time, alternating colors, into the prepared pan.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue baking for another 20 minutes, or until the top of the cake springs back when pressed.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Without removing cake from pan, invert pan onto a wire rack to cool. Once completely cooled, remove cake from the pan and frost with your choice of frosting. Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting works quite well.

        <img src="./images/Desert/banana bread brownies.webp" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-pupose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 ounces dark chocolate, broken into pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 very eipe bananas, mashed(about 1 cup)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>12 slices banana(optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar(optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously butter a 9x9-inch square pan. A piece of parchment paper can also be added to the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.
        </p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a bowl; set aside. 
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each interval, 1 to 3 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add egg, vanilla, and mashed banana, and beat until combined. Add chocolate, and beat until mixture is well combined and smooth.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Use a spatula to mix in walnuts and chocolate chips, then use the spatula to mix in flour just until flour disappears. Transfer batter into the prepared pan and smooth top. Place banana slices on top, evenly spaced in a grid pattern.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer comes out almost clean but with some batter on the very tip. If you want fudgier brownies, do not overcook.
        </p>

        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>
            Let brownies cool in the pan. Cover, refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour, and serve chilled.
        </p>

        <h4>step 8</h4>
        <p>
            For optional banana brûlée: While brownies are cooling, cover each banana slice with a half teaspoon of sugar. Use a propane kitchen torch to melt the sugar until dark brown and bubbling. Be careful not to char the edges of the crust around the banana too much. This banana brûlée step can also be done before the brownies go into the oven.

            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Ganache</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>7 ounces(56% cacao)semisweet chocolate bar, coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rainbow candy-coated chocolate pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>Gather all Ingredients.</p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Prepare the Brownies: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 13- x 9-inch baking pan with aluminum foil, leaving a 2-inch overhang on short sides. Coat foil and sides of pan with baking spray; set aside.
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Microwave chocolate and butter in a large microwavable bowl on HIGH, stirring in 30 second intervals, until fully melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total. Whisk in cocoa, canola oil, and vanilla until fully combined.
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Whisk sugar and brown sugar into chocolate mixture until combined. Add eggs, 1 at a time, whisking until smooth and combined after each addition, about 2 minutes total. Gently fold in flour, cornstarch, salt, and baking powder until just combined, making sure not to overmix the batter, about 45 seconds.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Transfer to the prepared baking pan.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Bake in preheated oven until set and a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 55 to 60 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest in pan on a wire rack until room temperature, about 1 hour. Once at room temperature, cover, and place in refrigerator; chill completely, at least 1 more hour.
        </p>

        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>
            When brownie has chilled, prepare the Ganache: Place chocolate in a medium mixing bowl; set aside. Bring heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high, stirring occasionally. Pour heavy cream over chopped chocolate; whisk until chocolate is fully melted, about 45 seconds. Whisk in butter and salt until smooth and shiny; set aside.
        </p>

        <h4>step 8</h4>
        <p>
            Invert cooled Brownie onto a large cutting board and discard aluminum foil. Using a serrated knife, trim and discard outer edges, about 1/4-inch on all sides. Using an offset spatula, spread Ganache in an even layer over top of brownie. Sprinkle evenly with rainbow candy-coated chocolates. Chill Brownie, uncovered, until Ganache is mostly set, about 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 9</h4>
        <p>
            Cut Brownie into 12 even (4- x 2-inch) pieces. Using the back of the knife, make an indent going crosswise along center of each brownie.

            <li>2 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions/h3>
            <h4>step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Place butter in a light colored saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until butter has browned and begins to smell nutty, 7 to 10 minutes. Measure out 1/2 cup browned butter and pour into a large mixing bowl to cool to room temperature, 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve remaining browned butter (1/4 to 1/3 cup) for the filling.
            </p>

            <h4>step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Stir brown sugar and corn syrup into the bowl with cooled brown butter until thoroughly combined; stir in egg and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Add in oats, flour, cinnamon, 3/4 teaspoon salt, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, and allspice and stir until combined.
            </p>

            <h4>step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Scoop out 2 tablespoons of dough and carefully roll into a ball. Repeat with remaining dough. Place dough balls into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes.
            </p>

            <h4>step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line two baking sheets with silicone baking mats or parchment paper.
            </p>

            <h4>step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Place chilled balls of dough about 3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets (about 6 dough balls per pan). Bake one pan at a time until cookies begin to turn golden brown on the edges, 10 to 11 minutes. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </p>

            <h4>step 6</h4>
            <p>
                To make filling, place cream cheese into a large bowl and beat with a mixer until soft and smooth. Beat in reserved 1/4 to 1/3 cup brown butter. Beat in 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon vanilla, then beat in 1 cup powdered sugar. Beat in remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar as needed to make a smooth, spreadable filling. Place filling into a piping bag and snip off the end. Keep filling refrigerated until ready to use.
            </p>

            <li>1 cup full-fat sour cream, at room temperature</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Make frosting: Place dark chocolate chips in a large bowl; set aside.
        </p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Combine 1 1/2 cups white sugar, water, and corn syrup in a light colored, tall-sided saucepan. Place pan over medium heat and cook until mixture begins to turn a deep amber color, swirling pan often to combine ingredients; about 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat and carefully pour in heavy cream (mixture will bubble up rapidly and then seize, this is ok). Place pan back over low heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Allow mixture to boil for 5 minutes, stirring constantly, then immediately pour caramel over the chocolate chips. Allow mixture to stand for 1 minute.
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Gently stir until chocolate is melted and smooth. Add in 2 teaspoons vanilla and Irish Cream and mix until combined. Add in butter 1 tablespoon at a time, making sure each addition is fully incorporated before adding the next, until all 3 tablespoons of butter are incorporated. Loosely cover bowl with a kitchen towel and set aside to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally (this will take 4 to 6 hours).
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Combine stout beer and 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar in a saucepan set over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced to 1 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 (9-inch) round cake pans.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Sift together flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon salt; set dry ingredients aside.
        </p>

        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>
            Beat 1/2 cup unsalted butter, vegetable oil, 1 cup dark brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar together in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition, and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat mixture on medium-high speed for 4 to 5 additional minutes after adding in the last egg. Mix in sour cream and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. 
        </p>

        <h4>step 8</h4>
        <p>
            Pour in half of dry ingredients and mix on low until just combined. Pour in cooled stout mixture and mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix until just combined.
        </p>

        <h4>step 9</h4>

            Bake in the preheated oven and until the tops of the cakes spring back lightly when touched, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 20 to 30 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 1 hour.

            Once cakes and frosting are both cooled, place one cake layer on a serving platter. Top with about 1 cup frosting; spread it into an even layer. Top with remaining cake. Pour remaining frosting over the top of the cake and smooth over top and sides of cake until completely frosted on all sides.

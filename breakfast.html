        <img src="./images/breakfast/perfect pancakes.webp" alt="">
        <hr>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened, or as needed, for greasing, plus more of serving</li>
            <li>toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat a griddle to 300 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Stir together milk and vinegar in a small bowl or a 4-cup liquid measuring cup.
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a second bowl.
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Beat eggs in a large bowl until smooth. Add vanilla and milk mixture; whisk together. Add flour mixture to bowl with egg mixture and whisk until just combined. (Batter will be lumpy.) Let rest 3 minutes and gently stir again.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            Melt some butter on the griddle, then carefully wipe with a paper towel. (You want just a bit of a sheen; donâ€™t overgrease the griddle.) Spoon batter in 1/3-cup portions onto griddle. Cook until bubbles form on surface of batter, about 2 1/2 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Flip pancakes and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 1/2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately with butter and toppings.

            <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinamon</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground allspie</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/ cup butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>orange food coloring(optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>sep 1</h4>
        <p>
            Combine flour, pumpkin puree, warm milk, egg yolk, melted butter, sugar, active dry yeast, salt, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment. Mix until a smooth, slightly elastic ball forms or knead by hand for about 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Place the dough in a lightly greased mixing bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours.
        </p>

        <h4>step 3</h4>
        <p>
            While dough is rising, combine powdered sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, salt, and vanilla extract in a bowl for the topping. Mix with your hands or a spatula until a moldable dough forms. Mix in orange food coloring if you like.
        </p>

        <h4>step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Divide topping dough into 6 equal portions and shape them into balls; set onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Cover each ball with a sheet of plastic and press down with something flat and heavy (like the bottom of a glass or measuring cup) into a flat circle. Take the tip of a knife and score a pumpkin design into the topping. Place in the refrigerator to allow butter to firm up.
        </p>

        <h4>step 5</h4>
        <p>
            After the dough rises, transfer it onto a work surface and press down to remove the air. Cut into 6 equal portions and roll each portion into a smooth ball. Transfer balls onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet and press down to flatten lightly. Place the topping on top of the dough balls. Allow to proof until doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
        </p>

        <h4>step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </p>

        <h4>step 7</h4>
        <p>
            Bake in the center of a preheated oven until puffed up and golden, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.

            Heat a non stick skillet over medium heat and cook sausage until crumbly, 3 to 5 minutes. Add in the onion and cook, stirring and breaking up the sausage until it is no longer pink. Transfer mixture to a paper towel-lined plate and drain for 3 to 5 minutes.
